TaxSmile is an online income tax return (ITR) filing portal in India.

It’s a private platform (not the official Income Tax Dept. portal), but it helps individuals, professionals, and businesses file their returns easily.

It provides guided filing, expert-assisted filing, and ITR review services.

The idea is to make ITR filing simpler for taxpayers by handling form selection, error-checking, and submission to the government system.

## On-Premises 

* You **buy physical servers** from a vendor in Germany (takes ~2 weeks).
* You need **Network Engineers** working 24/7 (3 shifts + 1 backup team).
* You must pay for **power**, **UPS backup**, **cooling**, and even **room rent** for the servers.
* Adding more servers later (for load testing) = more cost, more space, more setup.

 In short: You spend money **beforehand (CapEx)** and manage everything yourself.

##  Azure (Cloud) Version

* Instead of waiting for servers, you just **create Virtual Machines (VMs) in Azure** → ready in minutes.
* No physical network setup → you only set up **Virtual Network (VNet)**, firewalls, and load balancer inside Azure.
* You don’t need 3–4 teams working 24/7 physically.

  * Instead, you need a **smaller CloudOps/DevOps team** to monitor using **Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, Sentinel**.
* No need to pay for power, cooling, or room rent → Microsoft takes care of it.
* During Apr–Aug, you simply **scale from 2 VMs → 5 VMs** for load testing, then scale down to save cost.

 In short: You pay **only for what you use (OpEx)**, and scaling is flexible.


##  Cost Buckets in Azure (instead of CTC for infra)

1. **Compute** – Pay for VM size and hours 
2. **Storage** – For disks and backups.
3. **Networking** – Outbound internet usage.
4. **Team Cost** – Smaller but skilled cloud team.

Summary 

* On-prem = **buy servers, wait weeks, maintain power & staff, fixed cost**.
* Azure = **instant servers, no infra headaches, smaller team, pay only when you use**.


| **Factor**                  | **On-Premises (Physical Servers)**                   | **Azure (Cloud Servers)**                          |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Server Setup**            | Buy from vendor (Germany) → wait ~2 weeks            | Create VMs in minutes on Azure                     |
| **Scaling (extra servers)** | Need to buy, install, wire, cool → takes time        | Just click to add more VMs → instant               |
| **Team Requirement**        | 3 shifts + 1 backup team (24/7 physical monitoring)  | Smaller CloudOps team (monitor with Azure tools)   |
| **Power & Cooling**         | You pay for electricity, UPS, generator, AC          | Microsoft handles all power & cooling              |
| **Server Room Rent**        | Dedicated room, monthly rent                         | No room needed, all in cloud                       |
| **Load Testing (Apr–Aug)**  | Add 3 more physical servers (big cost + infra setup) | Add 3 more VMs temporarily → pay only for 5 months |
| **Cost Model**              | **CapEx** = Upfront fixed cost (servers, infra)      | **OpEx** = Pay-as-you-go (hourly/monthly billing)  |
| **Flexibility**             | Hard to shrink once servers are bought               | Scale up or down anytime                           |
| **Risk**                    | Hardware delivery delays, power failure              | High availability built into Azure                 |
